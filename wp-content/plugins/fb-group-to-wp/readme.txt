Pull your facebook group feed to WordPress

== Description ==

A simple plugin that imports posts from **public** facebook groups to your WordPress blog, every half hour!

= What it does & doesn't =

* Imports from facebook group and inserts as `fb_group_post` post type
* No chance for duplication
* It imports comments as well
* Runs every half hour via WordPress cron system
* Adds group id, author name and ID, post link as post meta
* If you want to trigger the importing manually, go to `http://example.com/?fb2wp_test`
* Import historical (paginated) posts. To do this, go to `http://example.com/?fb2wp_hist` and it'll automatically start the import process. Only admins can run this task.
